    <p>In this document we'll discuss the reasoning behind this API and the building blocks used in its design.</p>
    <h2>The small component</h2>
    <p>There has been a shift in the componentisation of UIs. Style guides with documentation on small components
        has become more common and UI frameworks such as Bootstrap are extremely popular. And it makes sense - each
        UI is nothing more than a set of components. Some are specific to a design, but most are interchangable with
        just a new lick of paint.</p>
    <p>But changing those licks of paint can be a painful process. Taking Bootstrap as an example, say we wanted to
        change the scale of our border-radius. Make everything a bit rounder and smoother in the next iteration of
        our design.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap has 58 occurrences of <code>border-radius</code> in their code, out of which 52 - or 90% if you
        wish - provide 6 properties: <code>0, 0.2rem, 0.25rem, 0.3rem, 1rem, 50%</code>. Declaring multiple,
        single-purpose CSS classes would help reduce complexity. Take the class <code>.br0</code> for example.
        3 letters that stand for <code>border-radius: 0</code>. Clear and concise.</p>
    <p>But it's not just that. File sizes are reduced too. Having <code>border-radius:;</code> in your code 58
        times is 870 characters, compared to 150 when using generic classes. That's 870 characters not included
        in the file every visitor of your website <em>only for border-radius!</em></p>
    <p>And that's where <a href="http://tachyons.io/" target="_blank">Tachyons</a> comes in. It breaks down CSS in those
        elementary particles. This shifts the complexity from CSS to our HTML, which is what we'd want eventually.
        We want to declare components and understand what they do in just a glance. Compare the class declarations
        for a container: <code>container</code> and <code>w-100 mw-60 flex flex-column</code>. The latter is
        understandable right away, as you don't need to read the CSS declarations to see what it does.</p>
    <p>But what if you want to reuse more complex components with multiple attributes? That's a lot of extra class
        decorations! To answer that, we first need to touch on the idea of Atomic Design.</p>

    <h2>Atomic Design</h2>
    <p>Atomic Design centers around the decomposition of elements to their smallest usable state. A quick overview
        of the Atomic Design pattern:Atomic Design centers around the decomposition of elements to their smallest
        usable state. A quick overview of the Atomic Design pattern:</p>
    <p class="tc"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/atomic-design.jpg" alt="atomic design visualised" class="w-100"></p>
    <p><strong>Atoms.</strong> Atoms are the smallest building blocks. They are the HTML tags with its styling, the image, the button.
        Atoms can also be abstract small components like a color palette or an animation. They are small in size and purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Molecules.</strong> Putting together several atoms gives you a more complex structure. They are small collections of atoms
        that can be reused and serve a single purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Organisms.</strong> Molecules and atoms come together in more complex forms like organisms. It's a distinct section of a
        final interface.</p>
    <p><strong>Templates.</strong> Combining smaller components into a concrete template gives your the entire layout.</p>
    <p><strong>Pages.</strong> A page is a specific instance of a template.</p>
    <p>Atoms, molecules all originate from the component API. Organisms generally live in the project itself, as they are bespoke
        implementations with these core components.</p>
    <p>In this implementation I took it one step further by adding Tachyons to this system as <strong>Particles.</strong> Particles
        are the small components that make up atoms.</p>
    <p>This component API is a flavoured implementation of this design pattern and these terms are used throughout.</p>

    <h2>What the API does</h2>
    <p>The API and the Documentation on top of it serve as a living Style Guide. Everything is readable from the Documentation,
        components are visible and changes are visible on reload. These components can be called from the API, either through
        including the served CSS or by sending a GET request for molecules and organisms.</p>
    <p>Within the API there is a clear distinction between each part of the Atomic Design system. The Core Particles are meant
        to be used in every project, as all components are made up of them.</p>
    <p>The Atomic Components are extactly that. The difference between core particle and the particles in this list is that the
        latter is meant for non-core particles, for example a specific javascript hover animation. The core particles are CSS only.</p>
    <p>Atoms can be further specified with CSS classes. If you have a button with the classes <code>w4 h2 bg-wcag-primary bw0 br2
        hover-bg-primary-light2</code>, maintaining it can become a pain. Alternatively, we can create a class
        <code>.btn { @extend .., .. }</code>. Now we can manage all our button styles in one place again, while keeping the
        integrity of our componentised approach.</p>
    <p>Molecules can also be further specified in CSS to avoid cluttering the Core CSS. One example I encountered is a negative margin
        on an absolute element when you hover over it. Yes, you can create generic classes like <code>.hover-nmt2</code>, or we can
        create the particle <code>.foo:hover { @extend .nt2 }</code>. Now we have our hover on foo unique to our molecule, without
        extending our core.</p>
    <p>When you get to organisms and later templates, all generic behaviours should already be defined. There will be a mix of generic
        and project-specific components which get combined into a full layout.</p>
    <p>All that's needed now is to call the API with your data and retreive the filled components. The GET request works like this:
        <code>api-location/?name=component-name/vars=base64-encoded-JSON</code>. </p>

    <h2>Reduced complexity</h2>
    <p>So how does a component API reduce complexity? It's yet another system to manage, but one that fits into todays
        API-driven development. You get your data from an API, be it a headless CMS or a database wrapper or whatever you use.
        Why not take the same approach with your components?</p>
    <p>Grab data from an API, apply your business logic and put that data in a component API call. The idea is really simple.
        The reduced complexity in the projects you work on make them easier to handle, and good documentation is easy to do.</p>
    <p><img class="center" src="{{site.url}}/assets/architecture.jpg" alt="architecture view"></p>
    <p>The application architecture above shows a simple app that consumes the Component API. The documentation is a living document
        to reference and keep up-to-date. This scales well with multiple apps in a microservice architecture.</p>

    <h2>The DRY front-end</h2>
    <p>Writing a lot of code over an over is never fun. With a Component API, you can realise reusability in a straight-
        forward manner. No more copying, refactoring and breaking things. Always have your most up-to-date front-end code
        readily available.</p>
    <p>My experience has been positive so far, and I'm having fun building and extending the system. </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Credit where it's due: The Lonely Planet's <a href="https://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/"target="_blank">Rizzo</a>.
        Their implementation of a maintainable style guide resonated with me and it couples well with the principles of
        <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>. UI components are the building blocks
        for the larger components of templates. With good baseline CSS, like <a href="http://tachyons.io/" target="_blank">Tachyons</a>,
        you get a maintainable and componentised style guide.</p>
    <p>My own implementation uses Mustache as a templating engine, because it's infinitely portable. Since the API itself
        is just a set of logic-lesss <a href="https://mustache.github.io/" target="_blank">Mustache</a> templates and a single file, it has
        little complexity of itself. Add to that static docs that grabs uncached components and you're good to go. Developing
        in the docs itself is easy and is your documentation to boot.</p>
